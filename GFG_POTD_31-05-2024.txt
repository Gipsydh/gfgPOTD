Given a number n, Your task is to swap the two nibbles and find the resulting number. 

A nibble is a four-bit aggregation, or half an octet. There are two nibbles in a byte.
For example, the decimal number 150 is represented as 10010110 in an 8-bit byte. This byte can be divided into two nibbles: 1001 and 0110.

Example 1:

Input: n = 100
Output: 70
Explanation: 100 in binary is 01100100, two nibbles are (0110) and (0100). If we swap the two nibbles, we get 01000110 which is 70 in decimal.

CODE:
class Solution {
  public:
    int swapNibbles(int n) {
        // code here
        int a=n/16;
        int b=n%16;
        int ans=0;
        ans|=b;
        ans=ans<<4;
        ans|=a;
        return ans;
    }
};
